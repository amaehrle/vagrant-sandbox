vagrant-sandbox
================

Basic Vagrant box, with Java for development with Jdk and Maven

## Things needed

### Vagrant addons
```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```

### Ansible
* http://www.ansible.com/ 

### Still need to do properly:
* install intelliJ community edition
* clean up playbook and extract some of the things into different files
* get the gui to behave a little better, probably needs a reboot after install of gdm ....?
